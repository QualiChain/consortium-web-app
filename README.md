[logo]: https://web.ist.utl.pt/~ist180970/assets/img/qualichain-logo.png
A webapp for the Qualichain Portuguese PoC. The Qualichain Portuguese PoC is about the interaction between a higher education organization, IST (or TÃ©cnico Lisboa), and a recruiting organization, AMA.
Currently it supports only the Qualichain Recruiting module.

## Requirements
* Git
* Nodejs version >= 10.0.0 and npm version >= 6.0.0 (tested with Nodejs 14.15, npm 6.14)
* If using Windows: [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

####
## Setup and Run
1. Fork and clone the project 

2. Set the backend environment variables, by duplicating .env.example (home directory of the project). Rename it to .env and set its values.
This step includes the configuration of [Mlab][mlab]. If you cannot configure the database, request the support for a working URI.
### Run the App

In order to run the project the required libraries need to be installed.

1. Install [node][node]. We recommend installing it via [nvm][nvm].

[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

2. On the home directory of the project, run ```npm run first-setup```.


## Running the server
1. Go to the main directory and run ``npm run start``.
1. To access the user interface, open a browser (Chrome is recommended) and go to ``localhost:8080``.

## On QualiChain Recruiting

This is the module executed by a recruiting organization, e.g., a public administration organization like AMA or a company. This component is responsible for the diploma validation. It receives a PDF file representing a diploma as an input. 
Such PDF is titled with the Issuer ID + Civil ID, which constitutes the ID of the diploma. The hash of the diploma is calculated. Then, the corresponding hash of the diploma registered at the (Ropsten) Ethereum network is obtained, through the provided ID.

In case the calculated digest of the diploma matches the digest of the provided PDF, the diploma is valid, i.e., it is authentic and has not been modified. Otherwise, it is invalid.

The Issuer ID identifies the HEI that issued the diploma. You don't have to provide the address of the HEI's contract because the QualiChain Recruiting module gets it from the QualiChain Consortium smart contract, explained below.

**Note**: if you created a new HEI with the QualiChain Higher Education Module (above), you first must add it to the consortium before being able to run the QualiChain Recruiting. For that, you must first run the QualiChain Consortium module to register the new HEI (below).
## Troubleshooting
If the setup fails, run ``sudo apt-get install build-essential
                         ``
                         followed by ``rm package-lock.json && rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf ~/.node-gyp
                                       ``. Finally, run ``npm run first-setup``
